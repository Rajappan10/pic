The PIC16F877A is a popular, versatile, 8-bit Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) microcontroller from Microchip Technology, known for its use in a wide range of embedded systems and educational projects due to its robust feature set and ease of use.
The PIC16F877A microcontroller has three independent timers: Timer0 (8-bit), Timer1 (16-bit), and Timer2 (8-bit), which can function as timers, counters, or for PWM generation, offering versatile timing capabilities for various applications. 
Timer 0:An 8-bit timer/counter with a readable/writable register and a software-programmable prescaler, supporting internal (FOSC/4) or external clock sources.
Timer 1:A 16-bit timer/counter, also supporting internal/external clocks and an optional external crystal oscillator for low-power timing.
Timer 2:An 8-bit timer with programmable prescaler and postscaler, plus a period register (PR2) for flexible period setting and PWM generation. 
Timer 0 is mainly used for creating time delay.
It is mainly used for:
.generate accurate delays
.create software timners
Timer 1 is mainly used for precise timing and real-time operations.
It is mainly used for :
.capture and compare mode
.PWM signal generation
.measuring RPM
Timer 2 is mainly used for pwm generation and short time period.
It is mainly used for :
.motor speed control
.LED brightness
